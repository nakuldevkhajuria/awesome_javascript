1. interpreter language vs compiler language
2. Everything in js happens inside excecution context
3. Single threaded processes contain the execution of instructions in a single sequence
	3.1 syncronization vs asyncronization
4. DRY dont repeat youself
5. function harry() {}
6. varible are undefined in the starting of excution, when
nothing is inside code.
7. when alot of execution context containers are in the picture
, then a call stack(global execution context) will take place
 where FIFO will be happening.
8. what are different type of engines are there(interview questions)
9. www.javascripttutorial.net
10. namaste java script youtube page.
11. what is event loop in java script?
	what is execution context?
	what is call stack?
12. event loop has a timer(settime out)
13. why call stack is LIFO?
14. use Windows(button)+ " . " = emojis
15. word wrap, mouse zoom, and install es6 from charalampos
16. we can add script tag just before the body tag ends
17. <!-- <script>
    console.log("Hello worldðŸ™Œ")
    </scipt> -->
    way of writing the javascript code inside the html file.

    1.
         mind map
        a) declaration(let, const, var)
        b) Hoisting in Javascript
        c)undefined
    2. declaration has:
        number, "string", boolean, object(important in ), array are also a object, buffer.
        by using "console.log(typeof(a))" we can check the data type of a variable
    3. in HTML add <script src="./index.js"></script>
        and then we can move to a new file by name index.js to write the 
        javascipt code.
    4.	everything in javascript is converted into objects
    5.	shortcut for console.log() is clg.
    6. 	soon var will be depreciated from javascript. and reactjs we cannot use
        var and it also gives alot of confusion.
    7. 	let works as block scope{ghar, house} {}
    8. 	var --> variable{global scope}
        and let --> block scope.(works only inside the curly braces)
    9.	primarly three errors are there
        a) syntax errror(when a has already been declared, firstly var then const) go
        check for redeclaration of any particular variable.
        b) refference error
        c) type error
    10.	what is strict mode in javascipt?
    11.	` these are known as ____ literal.
    
        HOISTING IN JS
    12.	function trx(some parameters inside it){this is a block}
    13.	MEMORY COLUMN IS also known as variable environmennt.
    14. 	CODE COLUMN IS also known as thread of execution.
    15. 	as a whole it is known as execution context.
    16.	hoisting is not possible in let and const.
        function trex1(){}
    17.	var trex1= function(){} another way of writing a function.
    18.	var trex1=() =>{} known as fatter of functions
