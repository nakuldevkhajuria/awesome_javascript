    Question 1: What are promises and why do we need them?
    <pre>
        Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. They are easy to manage when dealing with 
        multiple asynchronous operations where callbacks can create callback hell leading to unmanageable code.

        var promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
            resolve('Welcome everyone');
           })
           
           promise
            .then(function(successMessage) {
            //success handler function is invoked
             console.log(successMessage);
            }, function(errorMessage) {
             console.log(errorMessage);
            })
           
            Second example:

            var promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
                const x = "mynameis";
                const y = "mynameis"
                if(x === y) {
                  resolve();
                } else {
                  reject();
                }
              });
                 
              promise.
                  then(function () {
                      console.log('Success, Your name is nakul');
                  }).
                  catch(function () {
                      console.log('Some error has occurred');
                  });
    </pre>

    Question 2: What is the purpose of async/await keywords?

    <pre>
        The async keyword turns a method into an async method, which allows you to use the await keyword in its body. 
        When the await keyword is applied, it suspends the calling method and yields control back to its caller until
         the awaited task is complete. await can only be used inside an async method


         You can not use the await keyword in a regular, non-async function. JavaScript engine will throw a syntax error 
         if you try doing so.
    </pre>

    Question 3: What is hoisting?

    <pre>
        Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope 
        before code execution. Inevitably, this means that no matter where functions and variables are declared, they are
         moved to the top of their scope regardless of whether their scope is global or local

    </pre>

    Question 4: What is the DOM?
    <pre>
        The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that 
        programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and 
        objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.
    </pre>

    Question 5: Difference between undefined vs not defined vs NaN

    <pre>
        Javascript null represents the intentional absence of any object value. The undefined property indicates that the
         variable has not been assigned a value or not declared at all. The NaN property represents a “Not-a-Number” 
         value. The NaN property indicates that a value is not a legitimate number.

    </pre>

    Question 6:How many operators do we have in JS ?

    <pre>
        JavaScript includes operators that perform some operation on single or multiple operands (data value) and produce 
        a result. JavaScript includes various categories of operators: Arithmetic operators, Comparison operators, 
        Logical operators, Assignment operators, Conditional operators.

    </pre>

    Question 7: What is callback hell

    <pre>
        Callback Hell: Callback Hell is essentially nested callbacks stacked below one another forming a pyramid structure. Every callback depends/waits for the previous callback, thereby making a pyramid structure that affects the readability and maintainability of the code.
    </pre>

    Question 8: What is promise chaining

    <pre>
        Promise chaining: Promise chaining is a syntax that allows you to chain together multiple asynchronous tasks in a 
        specific order. This is great for complex code where one asynchronous task needs to be performed after the 
        completion of a different asynchronous task.

    </pre>

    Question 9: What are arrow functions?

    <pre>
        Arrow function is one of the features introduced in the ES6 version of JavaScript. It allows you to create 
        functions in a cleaner way compared to regular functions.


        functions which includes a fatty arrow. and on the left side we have inputs and on right we have
        output code
        it looks like this:
        () => {}
        if we need to give name to it.
        let testCase = () => {}
    </pre>

    Question 10: Give an example of async/await
