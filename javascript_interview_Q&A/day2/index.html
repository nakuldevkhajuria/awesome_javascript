    Question 1: Explain call(), apply() and, bind() methods. Give an example of call(), apply(), bind()
    <pre>

        All three of the call, bind, and apply methods set the this argument to the function.

        1.  The call and apply methods set this to a function and call the function.
        2.  The bind method will only set this to a function. We will need to separately invoke the function.

    Call

        function test(arg1, arg2){
            console.log(this.num, arg1, arg2); // 100, 10, 20
          }
          
          test.call({num: 100}, 10, 20);
          
          here, {num :100} is an object, which will take place of this, in the function test.
          and Object.num will be accessed 


    Apply


          function test(...arguments){
            console.log(this.num, arguments);//100, [1,2,3]
          }
          
          test.apply({num: 100}, [1,2,3]); 

          The apply method binds the this value to the function and executes the function. It takes the this value and a single array object as parameters, and it returns the value returned by the function, which is called using the apply method.

    bind

        The bind method binds the this value to the function and returns a new function. However, we still need to separately invoke the returned function.

        function test(arg){
         console.log(this.number, arg);
            }

        let bindedFn = test.bind({number: 99}, "argument");

        bindedFn(); // 99, "argument"


    </pre>

    Question 2: What are objects in javascript?
    <pre>
        Every thing in javascript is an object.
        Object is an standalone entity, with properties and types.
        like a book has a property like total pages, size of the page and all.
        like a car has a property like its tires, engine, speed. and all.
    
        JavaScript objects can have properties, which define their characteristics.
</pre>

    Question 3:  What are function constructors?
    <pre>
    The Function() constructor creates a new Function object. Calling the constructor directly can create functions 
    dynamically, but suffers from security and similar (but far less significant) performance issues as eval(). However,
    unlike eval (which may have access to the local scope), the Function constructor creates functions which execute in 
     the global scope only.


    These are the Syntax used by the Functional constructor to create a Function dynamically.

    new Function(functionBody)
    new Function(arg0, functionBody)
    new Function(arg0, arg1, functionBody)
    new Function(arg0, arg1, /* … ,*/ argN, functionBody)

    example:

    const sum = new Function('a', 'b' ,'return a + b');

    console.log(sum(2, 6));
    // expected output: 8

    const multiply = new Function('a', 'b' ,'return a * b');

    console.log(multiply(2, 6));
    // expected output: 8

    const power = new Function('a' ,'return a**3 ');

    console.log(power(2));
    // expected output: 8
</pre>
    Question 4: Explain prototypes?

    <pre>
        Every object in JavaScript has a built-in property, which is called its prototype. 
        The prototype is itself an object, so the prototype will have its own prototype,
        making what's called a prototype chain. The chain ends when we reach a prototype 
        that has null for its own prototype.
        object --> object constructor --> null
        function --> function constructor --> object constructor --> null


    </pre>

    Question 5: Give an example of inheritance using function constructor

    <pre>
        function Coder(name,age, gender, id){
            this.name = name;
            this.age = age;
            this.gender = gender;
            this.id = id;
        }
        
        function programmer(name,age, gender,id, specialization){
            Coder.call(this,name,age,gender,id)//dont forget to include this, when are calling it using the call method.
            this.specialization = specialization;//help in taking the input and assigning
            
        }
        const elo = new Coder('raju',3,'male',2);
        const eloo = new programmer('neha',1,'female',4,'Full stack developer');
        console.log(elo)
        console.log(eloo)


        Here programmer function is inheriting properties inside Coder and also adding a new property of Specialization.
        here we are using Function constructor(elo,  eloo) 

        In JavaScript, the this keyword refers to an object.

        Which object depends on how this is being invoked (used or called).
        Methods like call(), apply(), and bind() can refer this to any object.
    </pre>

    Question 6: What are callbacks?

    <pre>
        Callbacks make sure that a function is not going to run before a task is completed but will run right after the task has completed.
        It helps us develop asynchronous JavaScript code and keeps us safe from problems and errors.

        const button = document.getElementById('fetchusers');

        button.addEventListeners('click', fetchUsers);

        here we have created a button and accessing it using get element by id.
        to add a event we used addEventListeners and on clicking "fetchusers"(call back function) function is called.

    Question 7: What is the use of setTimeout?
    <pre>
        Syntax for setTimeout

        setTimeout(code)
        setTimeout(code, delay)

        setTimeout(functionRef)
        setTimeout(functionRef, delay)
        setTimeout(functionRef, delay, param1)
        setTimeout(functionRef, delay, param1, param2)
        setTimeout(functionRef, delay, param1, param2, /* … ,*/ paramN)

         the function will be executed when the delay time is completed

         Example:
            setTimeout(raju,3000)
            function raju(){
            console.log('heloo')

        </pre>

    Question 8: What are pure functions?

    <pre>

        A Pure Function is a function (a block of code) that always returns the same result
        if the same arguments are passed.

        function calculateGST( productPrice ) {
            return productPrice * 0.05;
        }
        this is a pure function, can output is not getting effected by any variable

        here we are not having any external variable.

        let tax = 20;
        function calculateGST( productPrice ) {
            return productPrice * 0.05*tax;

        now this is not a pure function cause, when ever value of external variable(tax) is getting
        changed the output is also getting changed.
